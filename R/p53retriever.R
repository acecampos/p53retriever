#'  detection and display of p53 putative response elements (REs) on DNA sequences
#'
#'p53retriever implements a pattern search algorithm that maps p53
#'response elements (REs) and ranks them according to predicted transactivation
#'potentials in five classes. Besides canonical, full site REs, p53tracker
#'contains specific pattern searches for non-canonical half sites and 3/4 sites.
#'REs can be displayed along the input sequence in a graphical layout.
